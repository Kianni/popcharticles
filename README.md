# Roadmap

## Phase 1: Foundations (1-2 Weeks)
- Set up the project environment: Node.js, MongoDB, and Guardian API integration.
- Implement basic user authentication (registration and login/logout).
- Create MongoDB schemas for users, searches, and visualizations.

## Phase 2: Core Functionality (2-3 Weeks)
- Implement article search and data ranking.
- Develop the bar chart visualization (minimal interactivity first).
- Store and retrieve searches and visualizations linked to user accounts.

## Phase 3: Enhancements (2 Weeks)
- Add interactivity to the bar chart (hover for abstract, click for article).
- Implement the download functionality for the chart and CSV data.
- Build the user dashboard to view past searches and visualizations.

## Phase 4: Polishing and Testing (1 Week)
- Ensure authentication flows are secure (e.g., validate JWT, handle token expiration).
- Conduct end-to-end testing of all features.
- Refine UI/UX, focusing on responsiveness and accessibility.
